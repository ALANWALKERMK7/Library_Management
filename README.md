# Library_Management
# Library management is Python based user interface created using tkinter module and mongodb.
# This abstract introduces a library management system that utilizes MongoDB, a
  NoSQL document-oriented database. The system offers cataloging, circulation,
  patron management, and reporting functionalities, all supported by MongoDB's
  flexible data model. MongoDB allows for efficient management of diverse
  library resources with varying metadata. The system also leverages MongoDB's
  scalability and high availability features to handle large collections of data and
  increasing user demands. Advanced search capabilities enable users to search
  for resources based on various criteria. The system offers improved data
  flexibility, scalability, and performance, making it a compelling choice for
  modern libraries. 
# It can be easily integrated with other library applications and services. Overall, the proposed system using MongoDB enhances library resource management, offering a seamless and efficient user experience.

# SOFTWARE:
     Mongo DB
     VS CODE or PyCharm
